# Eleven

[*Eleven*](http://gotoeleven.co) is an app that that helps musicians create, discover, share and sort memorable sounds. The vision is to make the musical world into a better sounding one.

Eleven references the rock and roll cult classic movie "Spinal Tap". Particularly, the line "... Our amps go to eleven ..."

Eleven is an inspiration and an outlet for musical creativity. This tool allows users to browse through countless tone recipes for their respective instrument. For example, a guitarist writing a new song could open the app and browse through guitar tones until she hears something interesting. Any tones that she enjoys can be added to her personal archive to reference later and can be freely altered to suit her fancy. 
In the Eleven app, a tone might consist of several elements. A title, a 15 second (max) recording, reference photos of gear, and formula for how the sound was created would be most helpful.
